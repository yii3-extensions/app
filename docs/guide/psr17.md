# Http Factories

The [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) specification defines interfaces for HTTP factories.

These factories are used to create PSR-7 objects.

The following example shows how to create configuration for the HTTP factories, using the [httpsoft/http-message](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-message)
package:

The configuration file is located at: `config/web/psr-17.php`

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use HttpSoft\Message\RequestFactory;
use HttpSoft\Message\ResponseFactory;
use HttpSoft\Message\ServerRequestFactory;
use HttpSoft\Message\StreamFactory;
use HttpSoft\Message\UploadedFileFactory;
use HttpSoft\Message\UriFactory;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface;

return [
    RequestFactoryInterface::class => RequestFactory::class,
    ServerRequestFactoryInterface::class => ServerRequestFactory::class,
    ResponseFactoryInterface::class => ResponseFactory::class,
    StreamFactoryInterface::class => StreamFactory::class,
    UriFactoryInterface::class => UriFactory::class,
    UploadedFileFactoryInterface::class => UploadedFileFactory::class,
];
```

The following example shows how to create configuration for the HTTP factories, using the [nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7)
package:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Nyholm\Psr7\Factory\Psr17Factory;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface;

return [
    RequestFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
    ServerRequestFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
    ResponseFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
    StreamFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
    UriFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
    UploadedFileFactoryInterface::class => Psr17Factory::class,
];
```

Both packages give the same interfaces, so you can use any of them.
